--- abstract

The QUIC protocol design is resistant to transparent packet inspection,
injection, and modification by intermediaries. However, the server can
explicitly cooperate with network services by agreeing to certain conventions
and/or sharing state with those services. This specification provides a
standardized means of solving three problems: (1) maintaining routability to
servers via a low-state load balancer even when the connection IDs in use
change; (2) explicit encoding of the connection ID length in all packets to
assist hardware accelerators; and (3) injection of QUIC Retry packets by an
anti-Denial-of-Service agent on behalf of the server.

# Introduction

QUIC packets {{!RFC9000}} usually contain a connection ID to allow endpoints to
associate packets with different address/port 4-tuples to the same connection
context. This feature makes connections robust in the event of NAT rebinding.
QUIC endpoints usually designate the connection ID which peers use to address
packets. Server-generated connection IDs create a potential need for out-of-band
communication to support QUIC.

QUIC allows servers (or load balancers) to designate an initial connection ID to
encode useful routing information for load balancers.  It also encourages
servers, in packets protected by cryptography, to provide additional connection
IDs to the client.  This allows clients that know they are going to change IP
address or port to use a separate connection ID on the new path, thus reducing
linkability as clients move through the world.

There is a tension between the requirements to provide routing information and
mitigate linkability.  Ultimately, because new connection IDs are in protected
packets, they must be generated at the server if the load balancer does not have
access to the connection keys. However, it is the load balancer that has the
context necessary to generate a connection ID that encodes useful routing
information. In the absence of any shared state between load balancer and
server, the load balancer must maintain a relatively expensive table of
server-generated connection IDs, and will not route packets correctly if they
use a connection ID that was originally communicated in a protected
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.

This specification provides common algorithms for encoding the server mapping in
a connection ID given some shared parameters. The mapping is generally only
discoverable by observers that have the parameters, preserving unlinkability as
much as possible.

Aside from load balancing, a QUIC server may also desire to offload other
protocol functions to trusted intermediaries. These intermediaries might
include hardware assist on the server host itself, without access to fully
decrypted QUIC packets. For example, this document specifies a means of
offloading stateless retry to counter Denial of Service attacks. It also
proposes a system for self-encoding connection ID length in all packets, so that
crypto offload can consistently look up key information.

While this document describes a small set of configuration parameters to make
the server mapping intelligible, the means of distributing these parameters
between load balancers, servers, and other trusted intermediaries is out of its
scope. There are numerous well-known infrastructures for distribution of
configuration.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 {{?RFC2119}}.

In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation only when in
ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be interpreted as carrying
significance described in RFC 2119.

In this document, "client" and "server" refer to the endpoints of a QUIC
connection unless otherwise indicated.  A "load balancer" is an intermediary for
that connection that does not possess QUIC connection keys, but it may rewrite
IP addresses or conduct other IP or UDP processing. A "configuration agent" is
the entity that determines the QUIC-LB configuration parameters for the network
and leverages some system to distribute that configuration.

Note that stateful load balancers that act as proxies, by terminating a QUIC
connection with the client and then retrieving data from the server using QUIC
or another protocol, are treated as a server with respect to this specification.

For brevity, "Connection ID" will often be abbreviated as "CID".

## Notation

All wire formats will be depicted using the notation defined in Section 1.3 of
{{RFC9000}}. There is one addition: the function len() refers to the length of
a field which can serve as a limit on a different field, so that the lengths of
two fields can be concisely defined as limited to a sum, for example:

x(A..B)
y(C..B-len(x))

indicates that x can be of any length between A and B, and y can be of any
length between C and B provided that (len(x) + len(y)) does not exceed B.

The example below illustrates the basic framework:

~~~
Example Structure {
  One-bit Field (1),
  7-bit Field with Fixed Value (7) = 61,
  Field with Variable-Length Integer (i),
  Arbitrary-Length Field (..),
  Variable-Length Field (8..24),
  Variable-Length Field with Dynamic Limit (8..24-len(Variable-Length Field)),
  Field With Minimum Length (16..),
  Field With Maximum Length (..128),
  [Optional Field (64)],
  Repeated Field (8) ...,
}
~~~

# Protocol Objectives

## Simplicity

QUIC is intended to provide unlinkability across connection migration, but
servers are not required to provide additional connection IDs that effectively
prevent linkability.  If the coordination scheme is too difficult to implement,
servers behind load balancers using connection IDs for routing will use
trivially linkable connection IDs. Clients will therefore be forced to choose
between terminating the connection during migration or remaining linkable,
subverting a design objective of QUIC.

The solution should be both simple to implement and require little additional
infrastructure for cryptographic keys, etc.

## Security

In the limit where there are very few connections to a pool of servers, no
scheme can prevent the linking of two connection IDs with high probability.  In
the opposite limit, where all servers have many connections that start and end
frequently, it will be difficult to associate two connection IDs even if they
are known to map to the same server.

QUIC-LB is relevant in the region between these extremes: when the information
that two connection IDs map to the same server is helpful to linking two
connection IDs. Obviously, any scheme that transparently communicates this
mapping to outside observers compromises QUIC's defenses against linkability.

Though not an explicit goal of the QUIC-LB design, concealing the server mapping
also complicates attempts to focus attacks on a specific server in the pool.

# First CID octet {#first-octet}

The first octet of a Connection ID is reserved for two special purposes, one
mandatory (config rotation) and one optional (length self-description).

Subsequent sections of this document refer to the contents of this octet as the
"first octet."

## Config Rotation {#config-rotation}

The first two bits of any connection ID MUST encode an identifier for the
configuration that the connection ID uses. This enables incremental deployment
of new QUIC-LB settings (e.g., keys).

When new configuration is distributed to servers, there will be a transition
period when connection IDs reflecting old and new configuration coexist in the
network.  The rotation bits allow load balancers to apply the correct routing
algorithm and parameters to incoming packets.

Configuration Agents SHOULD deliver new configurations to load balancers before
doing so to servers, so that load balancers are ready to process CIDs using the
new parameters when they arrive.

A Configuration Agent SHOULD NOT use a codepoint to represent a new
configuration until it takes precautions to make sure that all connections using
CIDs with an old configuration at that codepoint have closed or transitioned.

Servers MUST NOT generate new connection IDs using an old configuration after
receiving a new one from the configuration agent. Servers MUST send
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames that provide CIDs using the new configuration, and
retire CIDs using the old configuration using the "Retire Prior To" field of
that frame.

It also possible to use these bits for more long-lived distinction of different
configurations, but this has privacy implications (see {{multiple-configs}}).

## Configuration Failover {#config-failover}

If a server has not received a valid QUIC-LB configuration, and believes that
low-state, Connection-ID aware load balancers are in the path, it SHOULD
generate connection IDs with the config rotation bits set to '11' and SHOULD use
the "disable_active_migration" transport parameter in all new QUIC connections.
It SHOULD NOT send NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames with new values.

A load balancer that sees a connection ID with config rotation bits set to
'11' MUST revert to 5-tuple routing.

## Length Self-Description

Local hardware cryptographic offload devices may accelerate QUIC servers by
receiving keys from the QUIC implementation indexed to the connection ID.
However, on physical devices operating multiple QUIC servers, it is impractical
to efficiently lookup these keys if the connection ID does not self-encode its
own length.

Note that this is a function of particular server devices and is irrelevant to
load balancers. As such, load balancers MAY omit this from their configuration.
However, the remaining 6 bits in the first octet of the Connection ID are
reserved to express the length of the following connection ID, not including
the first octet.

A server not using this functionality SHOULD make the six bits appear to be
random.

## Format

~~~
First Octet {
  Config Rotation (2),
  CID Len or Random Bits (6),
}
~~~
{: #first-octet-format title="First Octet Format"}

The first octet has the following fields:

Config Rotation: Indicates the configuration used to interpret the CID.

CID Len or Random Bits: Length Self-Description (if applicable), or random bits
otherwise. Encodes the length of the Connection ID following the First Octet.

# Load Balancing Preliminaries {#load-balancing}

In QUIC-LB, load balancers do not generate individual connection IDs for
servers.  Instead, they communicate the parameters of an algorithm to generate
routable connection IDs.

The algorithms differ in the complexity of configuration at both load balancer
and server. Increasing complexity improves obfuscation of the server mapping.

This section describes three participants: the configuration agent, the load
balancer, and the server. For any given QUIC-LB configuration that enables
connection-ID-aware load balancing, there must be a choice of (1) routing
algorithm, (2) server ID allocation strategy, and (3) algorithm parameters.

Fundamentally, servers generate connection IDs that encode their server ID.
Load balancers decode the server ID from the CID in incoming packets to route
to the correct server.

There are situations where a server pool might be operating two or more routing
algorithms or parameter sets simultaneously.  The load balancer uses the first
two bits of the connection ID to multiplex incoming DCIDs over these schemes
(see {{config-rotation}}).

## Unroutable Connection IDs {#unroutable}

QUIC-LB servers will generate Connection IDs that are decodable to extract a
server ID in accordance with a specified algorithm and parameters.  However,
QUIC often uses client-generated Connection IDs prior to receiving a packet from
the server.

These client-generated CIDs might not conform to the expectations of the
routing algorithm and therefore not be routable by the load balancer. Those that
are not routable are "unroutable DCIDs" and receive similar treatment
regardless of why they're unroutable:

* The config rotation bits ({{config-rotation}}) may not correspond to an active
configuration. Note: a packet with a DCID that indicates 5-tuple routing (see
{{config-failover}}) is always routable.
* The DCID might not be long enough for the decoder to process.
* The extracted server mapping might not correspond to an active server.

All other DCIDs are routable.

Load balancers MUST forward packets with routable DCIDs to a server in
accordance with the chosen routing algorithm.

Load balancers SHOULD drop short header packets with unroutable DCIDs.

The routing of long headers with unroutable DCIDs depends on the server ID
allocation strategy, described in {{sid-allocation}}. However, the load balancer
MUST NOT drop these packets, with one exception.

Load balancers MAY drop packets with long headers and unroutable DCIDs if
and only if it knows that the encoded QUIC version does not allow an unroutable
DCID in a packet with that signature. For example, a load balancer can safely
drop a QUIC version 1 Handshake packet with an unroutable DCID, as a
version 1 Handshake packet sent to a QUIC-LB routable server will always have
a server-generated routable CID. The prohibition against dropping packets with
long headers remains for unknown QUIC versions.

Furthermore, while the load balancer function MUST NOT drop packets, the device
might implement other security policies, outside the scope of this
specification, that might force a drop.

Servers that receive packets with unroutable CIDs MUST use the available
mechanisms to induce the client to use a routable CID in future packets. In
QUIC version 1, this requires using a routable CID in the Source CID field of
server-generated long headers.

## Fallback Algorithms {#fallback-algorithm}

There are conditions described below where a load balancer routes a packet using
a "fallback algorithm." It can choose any algorithm, without coordination with
the servers, but the algorithm SHOULD be deterministic over short time scales so
that related packets go to the same server. The design of this algorithm SHOULD
consider the version-invariant properties of QUIC described in {{!RFC8999}} to
maximize its robustness to future versions of QUIC.

A fallback algorithm MUST NOT make the routing behavior dependent on any bits
in the first octet of the QUIC packet header, except the first bit, which
indicates a long header. All other bits are QUIC version-dependent and
intermediaries SHOULD NOT base their design on version-specific templates.

For example, one fallback algorithm might convert a unroutable DCID to an
integer and divided by the number of servers, with the modulus used to forward
the packet. The number of servers is usually consistent on the time scale of a
QUIC connection handshake. Another might simply hash the address/port 4-tuple.
See also {{version-invariance}}.

## Server ID Allocation {#sid-allocation}

For any given configuration, the configuration agent must specify if server IDs
will be statically or dynamically allocated. Load Balancer configurations with
statically allocated server IDs explicitly include a mapping of server IDs to
forwarding addresses. The corresponding server configurations contain one or
more unique server IDs.

A dynamically allocated configuration does not have a pre-defined assignment,
reducing configuration complexity. However, it places limits on the maximum
server ID length and requires more state at the load balancer. In certain edge
cases, it can force parts of the system to fail over to 5-tuple routing for a
short time.

In either case, the configuration agent chooses a server ID length for each
configuration that MUST be at least one octet. For Static Allocation, the
maximum length depends on the algorithm. For dynamic allocation, the maximum
length is 7 octets.

A QUIC-LB configuration MAY significantly over-provision the server ID space
(i.e., provide far more codepoints than there are servers) to increase the
probability that a randomly generated Destination Connection ID is unroutable.

Conceptually, each configuration has its own set of server ID allocations,
though two static configurations with identical server ID lengths MAY use a
common allocation between them.

A server encodes one of its assigned server IDs in any CID it generates using
the relevant configuration.

### Static Allocation {#static-allocation}

In the static allocation method, the configuration agent assigns at least one
server ID to each server.

When forwarding a packet with a long header and unroutable DCID, load
balancers MUST forward packets with long headers and unroutable DCIDs
using an fallback algorithm as specified in {{fallback-algorithm}}.

### Dynamic Allocation

In the dynamic allocation method, the load balancer assigns server IDs
dynamically so that configuration does not require fixed server ID assignment.
This reduces linkability.  However, it requires state at the load balancer
that roughly scales with the number of connections, until the server ID
codespace is exhausted.

#### Configuration Agent Actions

The configuration agent does not assign server IDs, but does configure a server
ID length and an "LB timeout". The server ID MUST be at least one and no more
than seven octets.

#### Load Balancer Actions

The load balancer maintains a table of all assigned server IDs and
corresponding routing information, which is initialized empty. These tables are
independent for each operating configuration.

The load balancer MUST keep track of the most recent observation of each server
ID, in any sort of packet it forwards, in the table and delete the entries when
the time since that observation exceeds the LB Timeout.

Note that when the load balancer's table for a configuration is empty, all
incoming DCIDs corresponding to that configuration are unroutable by
definition.

The handling of an unroutable long-header packet depends on the reason for
unroutability. The load balancer MUST applyt this logic:

* If the config rotation bits do not match a known configuration, the load
balancer routes the packet using a fallback algorithm (see
{{fallback-algorithm}}).

* If there is a matching configuration, but the CID is not long enough to apply
the algorithm, the load balancer skips the first octet of the CID and then
reads a server ID from the following octets, up to the server ID length. If
this server ID matches a known server ID for that configuration, it forwards the
packet accordingly and takes no further action. If it does not match, it routes
using a fallback algorithm and adds the new server ID to that server's table
entry.

* If the sole reason for unroutability is that the server ID is not in the load
balancer's table, the load balancer routes the packet with a fallback
algorithm. It adds the decoded server ID to table entry for the server the
algorithm chooses and forwards the packet accordingly.

#### Server actions

Each server maintains a list of server IDs assigned to it, initialized empty.
For each SID, it records the last time it received any packet with an CID that
encoded that SID.

Upon receipt of a packet with a client-generated DCID, the server MUST follow
these steps in order:

* If the config rotation bits do not correspond to a known configuration, do not
attempt to extract a server ID.

* If the DCID is not long enough to decode using the configured algorithm,
extract a number of octets equal to the server ID length, beginning with the
second octet. If the extracted value does not match a server ID in the server's
list, add it to the list.

* If the DCID is long enough to decode but the server ID is not in the server's
list, add it to the list.

After any possible SID is extracted, the server processes the packet normally.

When a server needs a new connection ID, it uses one of the server IDs in its
list to populate the server ID field of that CID. It SHOULD vary this selection
to reduce linkability within a connection.

After loading a new configuration or long periods of idleness, a server may not
have any available SIDs. This is because an incoming packet may not the config
rotation bits necessary to extract a server ID in accordance with the
algorithm above. When required to generate a CID under these conditions, the
server MUST generate CIDs using the 5-tuple routing codepoint (see
{{config-failover}}. Note that these connections will not be robust to client
address changes while they use this connection ID. For this reason, a server
SHOULD retire these connection IDs and replace them with routable ones once
it receives a client-generated CID that allows it to acquire a server ID. As,
statistically, one in every four such CIDs can provide a server ID, this is
typically a short interval.

If a server has not received a connection ID encoding a particular server ID
within the LB timeout, it MUST retire any outstanding CIDs that use that server
ID and cease generating any new ones.

A server SHOULD have a mechanism to stop using some server IDs if the list
gets large relative to its share of the codepoint space, so that these
allocations time out and are freed for reuse by servers that have recently
joined the pool.

## CID format

All connection IDs use the following format:

~~~
QUIC-LB Connection ID {
    First Octet (8),
    Server ID (..),
    Nonce (..),
    For Server Use (..),
}
~~~
{: #plaintext-cid-format title="CID Format"}

Each configuration specifies the length of the Server ID and Nonce fields, with
limits defined for each algorithm.

The Server ID is assigned to each server in accordance with {{sid-allocation}}.
Dynamically allocated SIDs are limited to seven octets or fewer. Statically
allocated ones have different limits for each algorithm.

The Nonce is selected by the server when it generates a CID. As the name
implies, a server MUST use a nonce no more than once when generating a CID for
a given server ID and unique set of configuration parameters. Limits on the
length of the nonce are different for each algorithm.

The First Octet, Server ID, and Nonce comprise the minimum length Connection ID
for any given algorithm. The load balancer need not know the full connection ID
length to successfully process a packet, given that it is of minimum size.

The For Server Use field has any value and length chosen by the server, within
the connection ID length limits in the operative QUIC version. It SHOULD appear
random and SHOULD NOT link two connection IDs to the same connection, or indicate
they originate from the same server.

# Routing Algorithms

Encryption in the algorithms below uses the AES-128-ECB cipher. Future standards
could add new algorithms that use other ciphers to provide cryptographic agility
in accordance with {{?RFC7696}}. QUIC-LB implementations SHOULD be extensible to
support new algorithms.

## Plaintext CID Algorithm {#plaintext-cid-algorithm}

The Plaintext CID Algorithm makes no attempt to obscure the mapping of
connections to servers, significantly increasing linkability.

### Configuration Agent Actions

For static SID allocation, the server ID length is limited to 16 octets. The
nonce length MUST be zero.

### Load Balancer Actions

On each incoming packet, the load balancer extracts consecutive octets,
beginning with the second octet. These bytes represent the server ID.

### Server Actions

The server chooses how many octets to reserve for its own use, which MUST be at
least one octet.

When a server needs a new connection ID, it encodes one of its assigned server
IDs in consecutive octets beginning with the second.

## Stream Cipher CID Algorithm {#stream-cipher-cid-algorithm}

The Stream Cipher CID algorithm provides cryptographic protection at the cost of
additional per-packet processing at the load balancer to decrypt every incoming
connection ID. The CID format is depicted below.

### Configuration Agent Actions

The configuration agent assigns a server ID to every server in its pool, and
determines a server ID length (in octets) sufficiently large to encode all
server IDs, including potential future servers.

The nonce length MUST be no fewer than 4 and no more than 16 octets.

The server ID length and nonce length MUST sum to 19 or fewer octets, and
SHOULD sum to 15 or fewer octets to allow space for server use.

### Load Balancer Actions {#stream-cipher-load-balancer-actions}

Upon receipt of a QUIC packet, the load balancer extracts as many of the
earliest octets from the destination connection ID as necessary to match the
nonce length. The server ID immediately follows.

The load balancer decrypts the nonce and the server ID using the following three
pass algorithm:

* Pass 1:  The load balancer decrypts the server ID using 128-bit AES Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode, much like QUIC header protection. The encrypted nonce
octets are zero-padded to 16 octets.  AES-ECB encrypts this encrypted nonce
using its key to generate a mask which it applies to the encrypted server id.
This provides an intermediate value of the server ID, referred to as server-id
intermediate.

server_id_intermediate = encrypted_server_id ^ AES-ECB(key, padded-encrypted-nonce)

* Pass 2:  The load balancer decrypts the nonce octets using 128-bit AES
ECB mode, using the server-id intermediate as "nonce" for this pass. The
server-id intermediate octets are zero-padded to 16 octets.  AES-ECB encrypts
this padded server-id intermediate using its key to generate a mask which it
applies to the encrypted nonce. This provides the decrypted nonce value.

nonce = encrypted_nonce ^ AES-ECB(key, padded-server_id_intermediate)

* Pass 3:  The load balancer decrypts the server ID using 128-bit AES ECB mode.
The nonce octets are zero-padded to 16 octets.  AES-ECB encrypts this nonce
using its key to generate a mask which it applies to the intermediate server id.
This provides the decrypted server ID.

server_id = server_id_intermediate ^ AES-ECB(key, padded-nonce)

For example, if the nonce length is 10 octets and the server ID length is 2
octets, the connection ID can be as small as 13 octets.  The load balancer uses
the the second through eleventh octets of the connection ID for the nonce,
zero-pads it to 16 octets, uses xors the result with the twelfth and thirteenth
octet. The result is padded with 14 octets of zeros and encrypted to obtain a
mask that is xored with the nonce octets. Finally, the nonce octets are padded
with six octets of zeros, encrypted, and the first two octets xored with the
server ID octets to obtain the actual server ID.

This three-pass algorithm is a simplified version of the FFX algorithm, with
the property that each encrypted nonce value depends on all server ID bits, and
each encrypted server ID bit depends on all nonce bits and all server ID bits.
This mitigates attacks against stream ciphers in which attackers simply flip
encrypted server-ID bits.

The output of the decryption is the server ID that the load balancer uses for
routing.

### Server Actions

When generating a routable connection ID, the server writes arbitrary bits into
its nonce octets, and its provided server ID into the server ID octets. Servers
MAY opt to have a longer connection ID beyond the nonce and server ID. The
additional bits MAY encode additional information, but SHOULD appear essentially
random to observers.

If the decrypted nonce bits increase monotonically, that guarantees that nonces
are not reused between connection IDs from the same server.

The server encrypts the server ID using exactly the algorithm as described in
{{stream-cipher-load-balancer-actions}}, performing the three passes
in reverse order.

## Block Cipher CID Algorithm

The Block Cipher CID Algorithm, by using a full 16 octets of plaintext and a
128-bit cipher, provides higher cryptographic protection and detection of
unroutable connection IDs. However, it also requires connection IDs of at
least 17 octets, increasing overhead of client-to-server packets.

### Configuration Agent Actions

The server ID length MUST be no more than 12 octets. The server ID length and
nonce length MUST sum to exactly 16 octets.

The configuration agent also selects an 16-octet AES-ECB key to use for
connection ID decryption.

### Load Balancer Actions

Upon receipt of a QUIC packet, the load balancer reads the first octet to
obtain the config rotation bits. It then decrypts the subsequent 16 octets using
AES-ECB decryption and the chosen key.

The decrypted plaintext contains the server id and opaque server data in that
order. The load balancer uses the server ID octets for routing.

### Server Actions

The server encrypts both its server ID and a nonce in 16-octet block with
the configured AES-ECB key.

# ICMP Processing

For protocols where 4-tuple load balancing is sufficient, it is straightforward
to deliver ICMP packets from the network to the correct server, by reading the
echoed IP and transport-layer headers to obtain the 4-tuple. When routing is
based on connection ID, further measures are required, as most QUIC packets that
trigger ICMP responses will only contain a client-generated connection ID that
contains no routing information.

To solve this problem, load balancers MAY maintain a mapping of Client IP and
port to server ID based on recently observed packets.

Alternatively, servers MAY implement the technique described in Section 14.4.1
of {{RFC9000}} to increase the likelihood a Source Connection ID is included in
ICMP responses to Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU) probes.  Load balancers
MAY parse the echoed packet to extract the Source Connection ID, if it contains
a QUIC long header, and extract the Server ID as if it were in a Destination
CID.

# Retry Service {#retry-offload}

When a server is under load, QUICv1 allows it to defer storage of connection
state until the client proves it can receive packets at its advertised IP
address.  Through the use of a Retry packet, a token in subsequent client
Initial packets, and transport parameters, servers verify address ownership and
clients verify that there is no on-path attacker generating Retry packets.

A "Retry Service" detects potential Denial of Service attacks and handles
sending of Retry packets on behalf of the server. As it is, by definition,
literally an on-path entity, the service must communicate some of the original
connection IDs back to the server so that it can pass client verification. It
also must either verify the address itself (with the server trusting this
verification) or make sure there is common context for the server to verify the
address using a service-generated token.

There are two different mechanisms to allow offload of DoS mitigation to a
trusted network service. One requires no shared state; the server need only be
configured to trust a retry service, though this imposes other operational
constraints. The other requires a shared key, but has no such constraints.

## Common Requirements {#common-requirements}

Regardless of mechanism, a retry service has an active mode, where it is
generating Retry packets, and an inactive mode, where it is not, based on its
assessment of server load and the likelihood an attack is underway. The choice
of mode MAY be made on a per-packet or per-connection basis, through a
stochastic process or based on client address.

A configuration agent MUST distribute a list of QUIC versions the Retry Service
supports. It MAY also distribute either an "Allow-List" or a "Deny-List" of
other QUIC versions. It MUST NOT distribute both an Allow-List and a Deny-List.

The Allow-List or Deny-List MUST NOT include any versions included for Retry
Service Support.

The Configuration Agent MUST provide a means for the entity that controls the
Retry Service to report its supported version(s) to the configuration Agent. If
the entity has not reported this information, it MUST NOT activate the Retry
Service and the configuration agent MUST NOT distribute configuration that
activates it.

The configuration agent MAY delete versions from the final supported version
list if policy does not require the Retry Service to operate on those versions.

The configuration Agent MUST provide a means for the entities that control
servers behind the Retry Service to report either an Allow-List or a Deny-List.

If all entities supply Allow-Lists, the consolidated list MUST be the union of
these sets. If all entities supply Deny-Lists, the consolidated list MUST be
the intersection of these sets.

If entities provide a mixture of Allow-Lists and Deny-Lists, the consolidated
list MUST be a Deny-List that is the intersection of all provided Deny-Lists and
the inverses of all Allow-Lists.

If no entities that control servers have reported Allow-Lists or Deny-Lists,
the default is a Deny-List with the null set (i.e., all unsupported versions
will be admitted). This preserves the future extensibilty of QUIC.

A retry service MUST forward all packets for a QUIC version it does not
support that are not on a Deny-List or absent from an Allow-List. Note that if
servers support versions the retry service does not, this may increase load on
the servers.

Note that future versions of QUIC might not have Retry packets, require
different information in Retry, or use different packet type indicators.

### Considerations for Non-Initial Packets

Initial Packets are especially effective at consuming server resources
because they cause the server to create connection state. Even when mitigating
this load with Retry Packets, the act of validating an Initial Token and sending
a Retry Packet is more expensive than the response to a non-Initial packet with
an unknown Connection ID: simply dropping it and/or sending a Stateless Reset.

Nevertheless, a Retry Service in Active Mode might desire to shield servers
from non-Initial packets that do not correspond to a previously admitted
Initial Packet. This has a number of considerations.

* If a Retry Service maintains no per-flow state whatsoever, it cannot
distinguish between valid and invalid non-Initial packets and MUST forward all
non-Initial Packets to the server.

* For QUIC versions the Retry Service does not support and are present on the
Allow-List (or absent from the Deny-List), the Retry Service cannot distinguish
Initial Packets from other long headers and therefore MUST admit all long
headers.

* If a Retry Service keeps per-flow state, it can identify 4-tuples that have
been previously approved, admit non-Initial packets from those flows, and
drop all others. However, dropping short headers will effectively break Address
Migration and NAT Rebinding when in Active Mode, as post-migration packets will
arrive with a previously unknown 4-tuple. This policy will also break connection
attempts using any new QUIC versions that begin connections with a short header.

* If a Retry Service is integrated with a QUIC-LB routable load balancer, it
can verify that the Destination Connection ID is routable, and only admit
non-Initial packets with routable DCIDs. As the Connection ID encoding is
invariant across QUIC versions, the Retry Service can do this for all short
headers.

Nothing in this section prevents Retry Services from making basic syntax
correctness checks on packets with QUIC versions that it understands (e.g.,
enforcing the Initial Packet datagram size minimum in version 1) and
dropping packets that are not routable with the QUIC specification.

## No-Shared-State Retry Service

The no-shared-state retry service requires no coordination, except that the
server must be configured to accept this service and know which QUIC versions
the retry service supports. The scheme uses the first bit of the token to
distinguish between tokens from Retry packets (codepoint '0') and tokens from
NEW_TOKEN frames (codepoint '1').

### Configuration Agent Actions

See {{common-requirements}}.

### Service Requirements {#nss-service-requirements}

A no-shared-state retry service MUST be present on all paths from potential
clients to the server. These paths MUST fail to pass QUIC traffic should the
service fail for any reason. That is, if the service is not operational, the
server MUST NOT be exposed to client traffic. Otherwise, servers that have
already disabled their Retry capability would be vulnerable to attack.

The path between service and server MUST be free of any potential attackers.
Note that this and other requirements above severely restrict the operational
conditions in which a no-shared-state retry service can safely operate.

Retry tokens generated by the service MUST have the format below.

~~~
Non-Shared-State Retry Service Token {
  Token Type (1) = 0,
  ODCIL (7) = 8..20,
  Original Destination Connection ID (64..160),
  Opaque Data (..),
}
~~~
{: #nss-retry-service-token-format title="Format of non-shared-state retry service tokens"}

The first bit of retry tokens generated by the service MUST be zero. The token
has the following additional fields:

ODCIL: The length of the original destination connection ID from the triggering
Initial packet. This is in cleartext to be readable for the server, but
authenticated later in the token. The Retry Service SHOULD reject any token
in which the value is less than 8.

Original Destination Connection ID: This also in cleartext and authenticated
later.

Opaque Data: This data contains the information necessary to authenticate the
Retry token in accordance with the QUIC specification. A straightforward
implementation would encode the Retry Source Connection ID, client IP address,
and a timestamp in the Opaque Data. A more space-efficient implementation would
use the Retry Source Connection ID and Client IP as associated data in an
encryption operation, and encode only the timestamp and the authentication tag
in the Opaque Data. If the Initial Packet has altered the Connection ID or
source IP address, authentication of the token will fail.

Upon receipt of an Initial packet with a token that begins with '0', the retry
service MUST validate the token in accordance with the QUIC specification.

In active mode, the service MUST issue Retry packets for all Client initial
packets that contain no token, or a token that has the first bit set to '1'. It
MUST NOT forward the packet to the server. The service MUST validate all tokens
with the first bit set to '0'. If successful, the service MUST forward the
packet with the token intact. If unsuccessful, it MUST drop the packet. The
Retry Service MAY send an Initial Packet containing a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
with the INVALID_TOKEN error code when dropping the packet.

Note that this scheme has a performance drawback. When the retry service is in
active mode, clients with a token from a NEW_TOKEN frame will suffer a 1-RTT
penalty even though its token provides proof of address.

In inactive mode, the service MUST forward all packets that have no token or a
token with the first bit set to '1'. It MUST validate all tokens with the first
bit set to '0'. If successful, the service MUST forward the packet with the
token intact. If unsuccessful, it MUST either drop the packet or forward it
with the token removed. The latter requires decryption and re-encryption of the
entire Initial packet to avoid authentication failure. Forwarding the packet
causes the server to respond without the original_destination_connection_id
transport parameter, which preserves the normal QUIC signal to the client that
there is an on-path attacker.

### Server Requirements

A server behind a non-shared-state retry service MUST NOT send Retry packets
for a QUIC version the retry service understands. It MAY send Retry for QUIC
versions the Retry Service does not understand.

Tokens sent in NEW_TOKEN frames MUST have the first bit set to '1'.

If a server receives an Initial Packet with the first bit set to '1', it could
be from a server-generated NEW_TOKEN frame and should be processed in accordance
with the QUIC specification. If a server receives an Initial Packet with the
first bit to '0', it is a Retry token and the server MUST NOT attempt to
validate it. Instead, it MUST assume the address is validated, MUST include the
packet's Destination Connection ID in a Retry Source Connection ID transport
parameter, and MUST extract the Original Destination Connection ID from the
token cleartext for use in the transport parameter of the same name.

## Shared-State Retry Service {#shared-state-retry}

A shared-state retry service uses a shared key, so that the server can decode
the service's retry tokens. It does not require that all traffic pass through
the Retry service, so servers MAY send Retry packets in response to Initial
packets that don't include a valid token.

Both server and service must have time synchronized with respect to one another
to prevent tokens being incorrectly marked as expired, though tight
synchronization is unnecessary.

The tokens are protected using AES128-GCM AEAD, as explained in
{{token-protection-with-aead}}. All tokens, generated by either the server or
retry service, MUST use the following format, which includes:

- A 1 bit token type identifier. 
- A 7 bit token key identifier.
- A 96 bit unique token number transmitted in clear text, but protected as part
of the AEAD associated data.
- A token body, encoding the Original Destination Connection ID and the
Timestamp, optionally followed by server specific Opaque Data.

The token protection uses an 128 bit representation of the source IP address
from the triggering Initial packet.  The client IP address is 16 octets. If an
IPv4 address, the last 12 octets are zeroes. It also uses the Source Connection
ID of the Retry packet, which will cause an authentication failure if it
differs from the Destination Connection ID of the packet bearing the token.

If there is a Network Address Translator (NAT) in the server infrastructure that
changes the client IP, the Retry Service MUST either be positioned behind the
NAT, or the NAT must have the token key to rewrite the Retry token accordingly.
Note also that a host that obtains a token through a NAT and then attempts to
connect over a path that does not have an identically configured NAT will fail
address validation.

The 96 bit unique token number is set to a random value using a
cryptography-grade random number generator.

The token key identifier and the corresponding AEAD key and AEAD IV are
provisioned by the configuration agent.

The token body is encoded as follows:

~~~
Shared-State Retry Service Token Body {
   Timestamp (64),
   [ODCIL (8) = 8..20],
   [Original Destination Connection ID (64..160)],
   [Port (16)],
   Opaque Data (..),
}
~~~
{: #ss-retry-service-token-body title="Body of shared-state retry service tokens"}
The token body has the following fields:

Timestamp: The Timestamp is a 64-bit integer, in network order, that expresses
the expiration time of the token as a number of seconds in POSIX time (see Sec.
4.16 of {{TIME_T}}).

ODCIL: The original destination connection ID length. Tokens in NEW_TOKEN frames
do not have this field.

Original Destination Connection ID: The server or Retry Service copies this
from the field in the client Initial packet. Tokens in NEW_TOKEN frames do not
have this field.

Port: The Source Port of the UDP datagram that triggered the Retry packet.
This field MUST be present if and only if the ODCIL is greater than zero. This
field is therefore always absent in tokens in NEW_TOKEN frames.

Opaque Data: The server may use this field to encode additional information,
such as congestion window, RTT, or MTU. The Retry Service MUST have zero-length
opaque data.

Some implementations of QUIC encode in the token the Initial Packet Number used
by the client, in order to verify that the client sends the retried Initial
with a PN larger that the triggering Initial. Such implementations will encode
the Initial Packet Number as part of the opaque data. As tokens may be
generated by the Service, servers MUST NOT reject tokens because they lack
opaque data and therefore the packet number.

### Token Protection with AEAD {#token-protection-with-aead}

On the wire, the token is presented as:

~~~
Shared-State Retry Service Token {
  Token Type (1),
  Key Sequence (7),
  Unique Token Number (96),
  Encrypted Shared-State Retry Service Token Body (64..),
  AEAD Integrity Check Value (128),
}
~~~
{: #ss-retry-service-token-wire-image title="Wire image of shared-state retry service tokens"}

The tokens are protected using AES128-GCM as follows:

* The Key Sequence is the 7 bit identifier to retrieve the token key and IV.

* The AEAD IV, is a 96 bit data which produced by implementer's custom
AEAD IV derivation function.

* The AEAD nonce, N, is formed by combining the AEAD IV with the 96 bit unique
token number. The 96 bits of the unique token number are left-padded with zeros
to the size of the IV. The exclusive OR of the padded unique token number and
the AEAD IV forms the AEAD nonce.

* The associated data is a formatted as a pseudo header by combining the
cleartext part of the token with the IP address of the client. The format of
the pseudoheader depends on whether the Token Type bit is '1' (a NEW_TOKEN
token) or '0' (a Retry token).

~~~
Shared-State Retry Service Token Pseudoheader {
  IP Address (128),
  Token Type (1),
  Key Sequence (7),
  Unique Token Number (96),
  [RSCIL (8)],
  [Retry Source Connection ID (0..20)],
}
~~~
{: #ss-retry-service-token-pseudoheader title="Psuedoheader for shared-state retry service tokens"}

RSCIL: The Retry Source Connection ID Length in octets. This field is only
present when the Token Type is '0'.

Retry Source Connection ID: To create a Retry Token, populate this field with
the Source Connection ID the Retry packet will use. To validate a Retry token,
populate it with the Destination Connection ID of the Initial packet that
carries the token. This field is only present when the Token Type is '0'.

* The input plaintext for the AEAD is the token body. The output ciphertext of
the AEAD is transmitted in place of the token body.
* The AEAD Integrity Check Value(ICV), defined in Section 6 of {{?RFC4106}}, is
computed as part of the AEAD encryption process, and is verified during
 decryption.

### Configuration Agent Actions

The configuration agent generates and distributes a "token key", a "token IV",
a key sequence, and the information described in {{common-requirements}}.

### Service Requirements {#ss-service}

In inactive mode, the Retry service forwards all packets without further
inspection or processing. The rest of this section only applies to a service in
active mode.

Retry services MUST NOT issue Retry packets except where explicitly allowed
below, to avoid sending a Retry packet in response to a Retry token.

The service MUST generate Retry tokens with the format described above when it
receives a client Initial packet with no token.

If there is a token of either type, the service MUST attempt to decrypt it.

To decrypt a packet, the service checks the Token Type and constructs a
pseudoheader with the appropriate format for that type, using the bearing
packet's Destination Connection ID to populate the Retry Source Connection ID
field, if any.

A token is invalid if:

* it uses unknown key sequence,

* the AEAD ICV does not match the expected value (By construction, it will only
match if the client IP Address, and any Retry Source Connection ID, also
matches),

* the ODCIL, if present, is invalid for a client-generated CID (less than 8 or
more than 20 in QUIC version 1),

* the Timestamp of a token points to time in the past (however, in order to
allow for clock skew, it SHOULD NOT consider tokens to be expired if the
Timestamp encodes a few seconds in the past), or

* the port number, if present, does not match the source port in the
encapsulating UDP header.

Packets with valid tokens MUST be forwarded to the server.

The service MUST drop packets with invalid tokens. If the token is of type '1'
(NEW_TOKEN), it MUST respond with a Retry packet. If of type '0', it MUST NOT
respond with a Retry packet.

### Server Requirements

The server MAY issue Retry or NEW_TOKEN tokens in accordance with {{RFC9000}}.
When doing so, it MUST follow the format above.

The server MUST validate all tokens that arrive in Initial packets, as they may
have bypassed the Retry service. It determines validity using the procedure
in {{ss-service}}.

If a valid Retry token, the server populates the
original_destination_connection_id transport parameter using the
corresponding token field. It populates the retry_source_connection_id transport
parameter with the Destination Connection ID of the packet bearing the token.

In all other respects, the server processes both valid and invalid tokens in
accordance with {{RFC9000}}.

For QUIC versions the service does not support, the server MAY use any token
format.

# Configuration Requirements

QUIC-LB requires common configuration to synchronize understanding of encodings
and guarantee explicit consent of the server.

The load balancer and server MUST agree on a routing algorithm, server ID
allocation method, and the relevant parameters for that algorithm.

All algorithm configurations can have a server ID length, nonce length, and key.
However, for Plaintext CID, the key is not used and the nonce length is always
zero. For Block Cipher CID, the nonce length is directly computed from the
server ID length.

If server IDs are statically allocated, the load balancer MUST receive the full
table of mappings, and each server must receive its assigned SID(s), from the
configuration agent. 

Note that server IDs are opaque bytes, not integers, so there is no notion of
network order or host order.

A server configuration MUST specify if the first octet encodes the CID length.
Note that a load balancer does not need the CID length, as the required bytes
are present in the QUIC packet.

A full QUIC-LB server configuration MUST also specify the supported QUIC
versions of any Retry Service. If a shared-state service, the server also must
have the token key.

A non-shared-state Retry Service need only be configured with the QUIC versions
it supports, and an Allow- or Deny-List. A shared-state Retry Service also needs
the token key, and to be aware if a NAT sits between it and the servers.

{{yang-model}} provides a YANG Model of the a full QUIC-LB configuration.

# Additional Use Cases

This section discusses considerations for some deployment scenarios not implied
by the specification above.

## Load balancer chains

Some network architectures may have multiple tiers of low-state load balancers,
where a first tier of devices makes a routing decision to the next tier, and so
on, until packets reach the server. Although QUIC-LB is not explicitly designed
for this use case, it is possible to support it.

If each load balancer is assigned a range of server IDs that is a subset of the
range of IDs assigned to devices that are closer to the client, then the first
devices to process an incoming packet can extract the server ID and then map it
to the correct forwarding address. Note that this solution is extensible to
arbitrarily large numbers of load-balancing tiers, as the maximum server ID
space is quite large.

## Moving connections between servers

Some deployments may transparently move a connection from one server to another.
The means of transferring connection state between servers is out of scope of
this document.

To support a handover, a server involved in the transition could issue CIDs that
map to the new server via a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame, and retire CIDs associated
with the new server using the "Retire Prior To" field in that frame.

Alternately, if the old server is going offline, the load balancer could simply
map its server ID to the new server's address.

# Version Invariance of QUIC-LB {#version-invariance}

Non-shared-state Retry Services are inherently dependent on the format (and
existence) of Retry Packets in each version of QUIC, and so Retry Service
configuration explicitly includes the supported QUIC versions.

The server ID encodings, and requirements for their handling, are designed to be
QUIC version independent (see {{RFC8999}}). A QUIC-LB load balancer will
generally not require changes as servers deploy new versions of QUIC. However,
there are several unlikely future design decisions that could impact the
operation of QUIC-LB.

The maximum Connection ID length could be below the minimum necessary for one or
more encoding algorithms.

{{unroutable}} provides guidance about how load balancers should handle
unroutable DCIDs. This guidance, and the implementation of an algorithm to
handle these DCIDs, rests on some assumptions:

* Incoming short headers do not contain DCIDs that are client-generated.
* The use of client-generated incoming DCIDs does not persist beyond a few round
trips in the connection.
* While the client is using DCIDs it generated, some exposed fields (IP address,
UDP port, client-generated destination Connection ID) remain constant for all
packets sent on the same connection.
* Dynamic server ID allocation is dependent on client-generated Destination CIDs
in Initial Packets being at least 8 octets in length. If they are not, the load
balancer may not be able to extract a valid server ID to add to its table.
Configuring a shorter server ID length can increase robustness to a change.

While this document does not update the commitments in {{RFC8999}}, the
additional assumptions are minimal and narrowly scoped, and provide a likely
set of constants that load balancers can use with minimal risk of version-
dependence.

If these assumptions are invalid, this specification is likely to lead to loss
of packets that contain unroutable DCIDs, and in extreme cases connection
failure.

Some load balancers might inspect elements of the Server Name Indication (SNI)
extension in the TLS Client Hello to make a routing decision. Note that the
format and cryptographic protection of this information may change in future
versions or extensions of TLS or QUIC, and therefore this functionality is
inherently not version-invariant.

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

QUIC-LB is intended to prevent linkability.  Attacks would therefore attempt to
subvert this purpose.

Note that the Plaintext CID algorithm makes no attempt to obscure the server
mapping, and therefore does not address these concerns. It exists to allow
consistent CID encoding for compatibility across a network infrastructure, which
makes QUIC robust to NAT rebinding. Servers that are running the Plaintext CID
algorithm SHOULD only use it to generate new CIDs for the Server Initial Packet
and SHOULD NOT send CIDs in QUIC NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames, except that it sends
one new Connection ID in the event of config rotation {{config-rotation}}.
Doing so might falsely suggest to the client that said CIDs were generated in a
secure fashion.

A linkability attack would find some means of determining that two connection
IDs route to the same server. As described above, there is no scheme that
strictly prevents linkability for all traffic patterns, and therefore efforts to
frustrate any analysis of server ID encoding have diminishing returns.

## Attackers not between the load balancer and server

Any attacker might open a connection to the server infrastructure and
aggressively simulate migration to obtain a large sample of IDs that map to the
same server. It could then apply analytical techniques to try to obtain the
server encoding.

The Stream and Block Cipher CID algorithms provide robust protection against
any sort of linkage. The Plaintext CID algorithm makes no attempt to protect
this encoding.

Were this analysis to obtain the server encoding, then on-path observers might
apply this analysis to correlating different client IP addresses.

## Attackers between the load balancer and server

Attackers in this privileged position are intrinsically able to map two
connection IDs to the same server.  The QUIC-LB algorithms do prevent the
linkage of two connection IDs to the same individual connection if servers make
reasonable selections when generating new IDs for that connection.

## Multiple Configuration IDs {#multiple-configs}

During the period in which there are multiple deployed configuration IDs (see
{{config-rotation}}), there is a slight increase in linkability. The server
space is effectively divided into segments with CIDs that have different config
rotation bits. Entities that manage servers SHOULD strive to minimize these
periods by quickly deploying new configurations across the server pool.

## Limited configuration scope

A simple deployment of QUIC-LB in a cloud provider might use the same global
QUIC-LB configuration across all its load balancers that route to customer
servers. An attacker could then simply become a customer, obtain the
configuration, and then extract server IDs of other customers' connections at
will.

To avoid this, the configuration agent SHOULD issue QUIC-LB configurations to
mutually distrustful servers that have different keys for encryption
algorithms. In many cases, the load balancers can distinguish these
configurations by external IP address.

However, assigning multiple entities to an IP address is complimentary with
concealing DNS requests (e.g., DoH {{?RFC8484}}) and the TLS Server Name
Indicator (SNI) ({{?I-D.ietf-tls-esni}}) to obscure the ultimate destination
of traffic. While the load balancer's fallback algorithm
({{fallback-algorithm}}) can use the SNI to make a routing decision on the
first packet, there are three ways to route subsequent packets:

* all co-tenants can use the same QUIC-LB configuration, leaking the server
mapping to each other as described above;

* co-tenants can be issued one of up to three configurations distinguished by
the config rotation bits ({{config-rotation}}), exposing information about the
target domain to the entire network; or

* tenants can use 4-tuple routing in their CIDs (in which case they SHOULD
disable migration in their connections), which neutralizes the value of
QUIC-LB but preserves privacy.

When configuring QUIC-LB, administrators must evaluate the privacy tradeoff
considering the relative value of each of these properties, given the trust
model between tenants, the presence of methods to obscure the domain name, and
value of address migration in the tenant use cases.

As the plaintext algorithm makes no attempt to conceal the server mapping,
these deployments SHOULD simply use a common configuration.

## Stateless Reset Oracle

Section 21.9 of {{RFC9000}} discusses the Stateless Reset Oracle attack.  For a
server deployment to be vulnerable, an attacking client must be able to cause
two packets with the same Destination CID to arrive at two different servers
that share the same cryptographic context for Stateless Reset tokens. As QUIC-LB
requires deterministic routing of DCIDs over the life of a connection, it is a
sufficient means of avoiding an Oracle without additional measures.

## Connection ID Entropy

The Stream Cipher and Block Cipher algorithms need to generate different cipher
text for each generated Connection ID instance to protect the Server ID. To
do so, at least four octets of the Block Cipher CID and at least eight octets
of the Stream Cipher CID are reserved for a nonce that, if used only once, will
result in unique cipher text for each Connection ID.

If servers simply increment the nonce by one with each generated connection ID,
then it is safe to use the existing keys until any server's nonce counter
exhausts the allocated space and rolls over to zero. Whether or not it
implements this method, the server MUST NOT reuse a nonce until it switches to a
configuration with new keys.

Configuration agents SHOULD implement an out-of-band method to discover when
servers are in danger of exhausting their nonce space, and SHOULD respond by
issuing a new configuration. A server that has exhausted its nonces MUST
either switch to a different configuration, or if none exists, use the 4-tuple
routing config rotation codepoint.

## Shared-State Retry Keys

The Shared-State Retry Service defined in {{shared-state-retry}} describes the
format of retry tokens or new tokens protected and encrypted using AES128-GCM.
Each token includes a 96 bit randomly generated unique token number, and an 8
bit identifier used to get the AES-GCM encryption context. The AES-GCM encryption
context contains a 128 bit key and an AEAD IV. There are three important
security considerations for these tokens:

* An attacker that obtains a copy of the encryption key will be able to decrypt
  and forge tokens.

* Attackers may be able to retrieve the key if they capture a sufficently large
  number of retry tokens encrypted with a given key.

* Confidentiality of the token data will fail if separate tokens reuse the
  same 96 bit unique token number and the same key.

To protect against disclosure of keys to attackers, service and servers MUST
ensure that the keys are stored securely. To limit the consequences of potential
exposures, the time to live of any given key should be limited.

Section 6.6 of {{?RFC9001}} states that "Endpoints MUST count the number of
encrypted packets for each set of keys. If the total number of encrypted packets
with the same key exceeds the confidentiality limit for the selected AEAD, the
endpoint MUST stop using those keys." It goes on with the specific limit: "For
AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM, the confidentiality limit is 2^23
encrypted packets; see Appendix B.1." It is prudent to adopt the same limit
here, and configure the service in such a way that no more than 2^23 tokens are
generated with the same key.

In order to protect against collisions, the 96 bit unique token numbers should
be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator
(CSPRNG), as specified in Appendix C.1 of the TLS 1.3 specification
{{!RFC8446}}. With proper random numbers, if fewer than 2^40 tokens are
generated with a single key, the risk of collisions is lower than 0.001%.

# Load Balancer Test Vectors {#test-vectors}

Each section of this draft includes multiple sets of load balancer
configuration, each of which has five examples of server ID and server use
bytes and how they are encoded in a CID.

In some cases, there are no server use bytes. Note that, for simplicity, the
first octet bits used for neither config rotation nor length self-encoding are
random, rather than listed in the server use field. Therefore, a server
implementation using these parameters may generate CIDs with a slightly different
first octet.

This section uses the following abbreviations:

~~~
cid      Connection ID
cr_bits  Config Rotation Bits
LB       Load Balancer
sid      Server ID
sid_len  Server ID length
su       Server Use Bytes
~~~

All values except length_self_encoding and sid_len are expressed in hexidecimal
format.

# Interoperability with DTLS over UDP

Some environments may contain DTLS traffic as well as QUIC operating over UDP,
which may be hard to distinguish.

In most cases, the packet parsing rules above will cause a QUIC-LB load
balancer to route DTLS traffic in an appropriate way. DTLS 1.3 implementations
that use the connection_id extension {{?I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} might
use the techniques in this document to generate connection IDs and achieve
robust routability for DTLS associations if they meet a few additional
requirements. This non-normative appendix describes this interaction.

## DTLS 1.0 and 1.2

DTLS 1.0 {{?RFC4347}} and 1.2 {{?RFC6347}} use packet formats that a QUIC-LB
router will interpret as short header packets with CIDs that request 4-tuple
routing.  As such, they will route such packets consistently as long as the
4-tuple does not change. Note that DTLS 1.0 has been deprecated by the IETF.

The first octet of every DTLS 1.0 or 1.2 datagram contains the content type.
A QUIC-LB load balancer will interpret any content type less than 128 as a short
header packet, meaning that the subsequent octets should contain a connection
ID.

Existing TLS content types comfortably fit in the range below 128. Assignment of
codepoints greater than 64 would require coordination in accordance with
{{?RFC7983}}, and anyway would likely create problems demultiplexing DTLS and
version 1 of QUIC. Therefore, this document believes it is extremely unlikely
that TLS content types of 128 or greater will be assigned. Nevertheless, such
an assignment would cause a QUIC-LB load balancer to interpret the packet as a
QUIC long header with an essentially random connection ID, which is likely to be
routed irregularly.

The second octet of every DTLS 1.0 or 1.2 datagram is the bitwise complement
of the DTLS Major version (i.e. version 1.x = 0xfe). A QUIC-LB load balancer
will interpret this as a connection ID that requires 4-tuple based load
balancing, meaning that the routing will be consistent as long as the 4-tuple
remains the same.

{{?I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} defines an extension to add connection IDs
to DTLS 1.2. Unfortunately, a QUIC-LB load balancer will not correctly parse
the connection ID and will continue 4-tuple routing. An modified QUIC-LB load
balancer that correctly identifies DTLS and parses a DTLS 1.2 datagram for
the connection ID is outside the scope of this document.

## DTLS 1.3

DTLS 1.3 {{?I-D.draft-ietf-tls-dtls13}} changes the structure of datagram
headers in relevant ways.

Handshake packets continue to have a TLS content type in the first octet and
0xfe in the second octet, so they will be 4-tuple routed, which should not
present problems for likely NAT rebinding or address change events.

Non-handshake packets always have zero in their most significant bit and will
therefore always be treated as QUIC short headers. If the connection ID is
present, it follows in the succeeding octets. Therefore, a DTLS 1.3 association
where the server utilizes Connection IDs and the encodings in this document
will be routed correctly in the presence of client address and port changes.

However, if the client does not include the connection_id extension in its
ClientHello, the server is unable to use connection IDs. In this case, non-
handshake packets will appear to contain random connection IDs and be routed
randomly. Thus, unmodified QUIC-LB load balancers will not work with DTLS 1.3
if the client does not advertise support for connection IDs, or the server does
not request the use of a compliant connection ID.

A QUIC-LB load balancer might be modified to identify DTLS 1.3 packets and
correctly parse the fields to identify when there is no connection ID and
revert to 4-tuple routing, removing the server requirement above. However, such
a modification is outside the scope of this document, and classifying some
packets as DTLS might be incompatible with future versions of QUIC.

## Future Versions of DTLS

As DTLS does not have an IETF consensus document that defines what parts of
DTLS will be invariant in future versions, it is difficult to speculate about
the applicability of this section to future versions of DTLS.
