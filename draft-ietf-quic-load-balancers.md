--- abstract

QUIC address migration allows clients to change their IP address while
maintaining connection state. To reduce the ability of an observer to link two
IP addresses, clients and servers use new connection IDs when they communicate
via different client addresses. This poses a problem for traditional "layer-4"
load balancers that route packets via the IP address and port 4-tuple. This
specification provides a standardized means of securely encoding routing
information in the server's connection IDs so that a properly configured load
balancer can route packets with migrated addresses correctly. As it proposes a
structured connection ID format, it also provides a means of connection IDs
self-encoding their length to aid some hardware offloads.

# Introduction

QUIC packets {{!RFC9000}} usually contain a connection ID to allow endpoints to
associate packets with different address/port 4-tuples to the same connection
context. This feature makes connections robust in the event of NAT rebinding.
QUIC endpoints usually designate the connection ID which peers use to address
packets. Server-generated connection IDs create a potential need for out-of-band
communication to support QUIC.

QUIC allows servers (or load balancers) to encode useful routing
information for load balancers in connection IDs.  It also encourages servers,
in packets protected by cryptography, to provide additional connection IDs to
the client.  This allows clients that know they are going to change IP address
or port to use a separate connection ID on the new path, thus reducing
linkability as clients move through the world.

There is a tension between the requirements to provide routing information and
mitigate linkability.  Ultimately, because new connection IDs are in protected
packets, they must be generated at the server if the load balancer does not have
access to the connection keys. However, it is the load balancer that has the
context necessary to generate a connection ID that encodes useful routing
information. In the absence of any shared state between load balancer and
server, the load balancer must maintain a relatively expensive table of
server-generated connection IDs, and will not route packets correctly if they
use a connection ID that was originally communicated in a protected
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.

This specification provides common algorithms for encoding the server mapping in
a connection ID given some shared parameters. The mapping is generally only
discoverable by observers that have the parameters, preserving unlinkability as
much as possible.

As this document proposes a structured QUIC Connection ID, it also proposes a
system for self-encoding connection ID length in all packets, so that crypto
offload can efficiently obtain key information.

While this document describes a small set of configuration parameters to make
the server mapping intelligible, the means of distributing these parameters
between load balancers, servers, and other trusted intermediaries is out of its
scope. There are numerous well-known infrastructures for distribution of
configuration.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119 {{?RFC2119}}.

In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation only when in
ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be interpreted as carrying
significance described in RFC 2119.

In this document, "client" and "server" refer to the endpoints of a QUIC
connection unless otherwise indicated.  A "load balancer" is an intermediary for
that connection that does not possess QUIC connection keys, but it may rewrite
IP addresses or conduct other IP or UDP processing. A "configuration agent" is
the entity that determines the QUIC-LB configuration parameters for the network
and leverages some system to distribute that configuration.

Note that stateful load balancers that act as proxies, by terminating a QUIC
connection with the client and then retrieving data from the server using QUIC
or another protocol, are treated as a server with respect to this specification.

For brevity, "Connection ID" will often be abbreviated as "CID".

## Notation

All wire formats will be depicted using the notation defined in Section 1.3 of
{{RFC9000}}. There is one addition: the function len() refers to the length of
a field which can serve as a limit on a different field, so that the lengths of
two fields can be concisely defined as limited to a sum, for example:

x(A..B)
y(C..B-len(x))

indicates that x can be of any length between A and B, and y can be of any
length between C and B provided that (len(x) + len(y)) does not exceed B.

The example below illustrates the basic framework:

~~~
Example Structure {
  One-bit Field (1),
  7-bit Field with Fixed Value (7) = 61,
  Field with Variable-Length Integer (i),
  Arbitrary-Length Field (..),
  Variable-Length Field (8..24),
  Variable-Length Field with Dynamic Limit
           (8..24-len(Variable-Length Field)),
  Field With Minimum Length (16..),
  Field With Maximum Length (..128),
  [Optional Field (64)],
  Repeated Field (8) ...,
}
~~~
{: #fig-ex-format title="Example Format"}

# First CID octet {#first-octet}

The Connection ID construction schemes defined in this document reserve the
first octet of a CID for two special purposes: one mandatory (config rotation)
and one optional (length self-description).

Subsequent sections of this document refer to the contents of this octet as the
"first octet."

## Config Rotation {#config-rotation}

The first two bits of any connection ID MUST encode an identifier for the
configuration that the connection ID uses. This enables incremental deployment
of new QUIC-LB settings (e.g., keys).

When new configuration is distributed to servers, there will be a transition
period when connection IDs reflecting old and new configuration coexist in the
network.  The rotation bits allow load balancers to apply the correct routing
algorithm and parameters to incoming packets.

Configuration Agents SHOULD deliver new configurations to load balancers before
doing so to servers, so that load balancers are ready to process CIDs using the
new parameters when they arrive.

A Configuration Agent SHOULD NOT use a codepoint to represent a new
configuration until it takes precautions to make sure that all connections using
CIDs with an old configuration at that codepoint have closed or transitioned.

Servers MUST NOT generate new connection IDs using an old configuration after
receiving a new one from the configuration agent. Servers MUST send
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames that provide CIDs using the new configuration, and
retire CIDs using the old configuration using the "Retire Prior To" field of
that frame.

It also possible to use these bits for more long-lived distinction of different
configurations, but this has privacy implications (see {{multiple-configs}}).

## Configuration Failover {#config-failover}

A server that is configured to use QUIC-LB might be forced to accept new
connections without having received a current configuration.  A server without
QUIC-LB configuration can accept connections, but it SHOULD generate initial
connection IDs with the config rotation bits set to 0b11 and avoid sending the
client connection IDs in NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames or the preferred_address
transport parameter.  Servers in this state SHOULD use the
"disable_active_migration" transport parameter until a valid configuration is
received.

A load balancer that sees a connection ID with config rotation bits set to
0b11 MUST route using an algorithm based solely on the address/port 4-tuple,
which is consistent well beyond the QUIC handshake. However, a load balancer MAY
observe the connection IDs used during the handshake and populate a connection
ID table that allows the connection to survive a NAT rebinding, and reduces the
probability of connection failure due to a change in the number of servers.

When using codepoint 0b11, all bytes but the first SHOULD have no larger of a
chance of collision as random bytes. The connection ID SHOULD be of at least
length 8 to provide 7 bytes of entropy after the first octet with a low chance
of collision. Furthermore, servers in a pool SHOULD also use a consistent
connection ID length to simplify the load balancer's extraction of a connection
ID from short headers.

## Length Self-Description

Local hardware cryptographic offload devices may accelerate QUIC servers by
receiving keys from the QUIC implementation indexed to the connection ID.
However, on physical devices operating multiple QUIC servers, it might be
impractical to efficiently lookup keys if the connection ID varies in length and
does not self-encode its own length.

Note that this is a function of particular server devices and is irrelevant to
load balancers. As such, load balancers MAY omit this from their configuration.
However, the remaining 6 bits in the first octet of the Connection ID are
reserved to express the length of the following connection ID, not including
the first octet.

A server not using this functionality SHOULD make the six bits appear to be
random.

## Format

~~~
First Octet {
  Config Rotation (2),
  CID Len or Random Bits (6),
}
~~~
{: #first-octet-format title="First Octet Format"}

The first octet has the following fields:

Config Rotation: Indicates the configuration used to interpret the CID.

CID Len or Random Bits: Length Self-Description (if applicable), or random bits
otherwise. Encodes the length of the Connection ID following the First Octet.

# Load Balancing Preliminaries {#load-balancing}

In QUIC-LB, load balancers do not generate individual connection IDs for
servers.  Instead, they communicate the parameters of an algorithm to generate
routable connection IDs.

The algorithms differ in the complexity of configuration at both load balancer
and server. Increasing complexity improves obfuscation of the server mapping.

This section describes three participants: the configuration agent, the load
balancer, and the server. For any given QUIC-LB configuration that enables
connection-ID-aware load balancing, there must be a choice of (1) routing
algorithm, (2) server ID allocation strategy, and (3) algorithm parameters.

Fundamentally, servers generate connection IDs that encode their server ID.
Load balancers decode the server ID from the CID in incoming packets to route
to the correct server.

There are situations where a server pool might be operating two or more routing
algorithms or parameter sets simultaneously.  The load balancer uses the first
two bits of the connection ID to multiplex incoming DCIDs over these schemes
(see {{config-rotation}}).

## Unroutable Connection IDs {#unroutable}

QUIC-LB servers will generate Connection IDs that are decodable to extract a
server ID in accordance with a specified algorithm and parameters.  However,
QUIC often uses client-generated Connection IDs prior to receiving a packet from
the server.

These client-generated CIDs might not conform to the expectations of the
routing algorithm and therefore not be routable by the load balancer. Those that
are not routable are "unroutable DCIDs" and receive similar treatment
regardless of why they're unroutable:

* The config rotation bits ({{config-rotation}}) may not correspond to an active
configuration. Note: a packet with a DCID with config ID codepoint 0b11 (see
{{config-failover}}) is always routable.
* The DCID might not be long enough for the decoder to process.
* The extracted server mapping might not correspond to an active server.

All other DCIDs are routable.

Load balancers MUST forward packets with routable DCIDs to a server in
accordance with the chosen routing algorithm. Exception: if the load balancer
can parse the QUIC packet and makes a routing decision depending on the
contents (e.g., the SNI in a TLS client hello), it MAY route in accordance with
this instead. However, load balancers MUST always route long header packets it
cannot parse in accordance with the DCID (see {{version-invariance}}).

Load balancers SHOULD drop short header packets with unroutable DCIDs.

When forwarding a packet with a long header and unroutable DCID, load
balancers MUST use a fallback algorithm as specified in {{fallback-algorithm}}.

Load balancers MAY drop packets with long headers and unroutable DCIDs if
and only if it knows that the encoded QUIC version does not allow an unroutable
DCID in a packet with that signature. For example, a load balancer can safely
drop a QUIC version 1 Handshake packet with an unroutable DCID, as a
version 1 Handshake packet sent to a QUIC-LB routable server will always have
a server-generated routable CID. The prohibition against dropping packets with
long headers remains for unknown QUIC versions.

Furthermore, while the load balancer function MUST NOT drop packets, the device
might implement other security policies, outside the scope of this
specification, that might force a drop.

Servers that receive packets with unroutable CIDs MUST use the available
mechanisms to induce the client to use a routable CID in future packets. In
QUIC version 1, this requires using a routable CID in the Source CID field of
server-generated long headers.

## Fallback Algorithms {#fallback-algorithm}

There are conditions described below where a load balancer routes a packet using
a "fallback algorithm." It can choose any algorithm, without coordination with
the servers, but the algorithm SHOULD be deterministic over short time scales so
that related packets go to the same server. The design of this algorithm SHOULD
consider the version-invariant properties of QUIC described in {{!RFC8999}} to
maximize its robustness to future versions of QUIC.

A fallback algorithm MUST NOT make the routing behavior dependent on any bits
in the first octet of the QUIC packet header, except the first bit, which
indicates a long header. All other bits are QUIC version-dependent and
intermediaries SHOULD NOT base their design on version-specific templates.

For example, one fallback algorithm might convert a unroutable DCID to an
integer and divided by the number of servers, with the modulus used to forward
the packet. The number of servers is usually consistent on the time scale of a
QUIC connection handshake. Another might simply hash the address/port 4-tuple.
See also {{version-invariance}}.

## Server ID Allocation {#sid-allocation}

Load Balancer configurations include a mapping of server IDs to forwarding
addresses. The corresponding server configurations contain one or
more unique server IDs.

The configuration agent chooses a server ID length for each configuration that
MUST be at least one octet.

A QUIC-LB configuration MAY significantly over-provision the server ID space
(i.e., provide far more codepoints than there are servers) to increase the
probability that a randomly generated Destination Connection ID is unroutable.

The configuration agent SHOULD provide a means for servers to express the
number of server IDs it can usefully employ, because a single routing address
actually corresponds to multiple server entities (see {{lb-chains}}).

Conceptually, each configuration has its own set of server ID allocations,
though two static configurations with identical server ID lengths MAY use a
common allocation between them.

A server encodes one of its assigned server IDs in any CID it generates using
the relevant configuration.

# Server ID Encoding in Connection IDs

## CID format

All connection IDs use the following format:

~~~
QUIC-LB Connection ID {
    First Octet (8),
    Server ID (8..152-len(Nonce)),
    Nonce (32..152-len(Server ID)),
}
~~~
{: #plaintext-cid-format title="CID Format"}

## Configuration Agent Actions

The configuration agent assigns a server ID to every server in its pool in
accordance with {{sid-allocation}}, and determines a server ID length (in
octets) sufficiently large to encode all server IDs, including potential future
servers.

Each configuration specifies the length of the Server ID and Nonce fields, with
limits defined for each algorithm.

Optionally, it also defines a 16-octet key. Note that failure to define a key
means that observers can determine the assigned server of any connection,
significantly increasing the linkability of QUIC address migration.

The nonce length MUST be at least 4 octets. The server ID length MUST be at
least 1 octet.

As QUIC version 1 limits connection IDs to 20 octets, the server ID and nonce
lengths MUST sum to 19 octets or less.

## Server Actions

The server writes the first octet and its server ID into their respective
fields.

If there is no key in the configuration, the server MUST fill the Nonce field
with bytes that appear to be random. If there is a key, the server fills the
nonce field with a nonce of its choosing. See {{cid-entropy}} for details.

The server MAY append additional bytes to the connection ID, up to the limit
specified in that version of QUIC, for its own use. These bytes MUST NOT
provide observers with any information that could link two connection IDs to
the same connection, client, or server. In particular, all servers using a
configuration MUST consistently add the same length to each connection ID,
to preserve the linkability objectives of QUIC-LB. Any additional bytes SHOULD
appear random unless individual servers are not distinguishable (e.g. any server
using that configuration appends identical bytes to every connection ID).

If there is no key in the configuration, the Connection ID is complete.
Otherwise, there are further steps, as described in the two following
subsections.

Encryption below uses the AES-128-ECB cipher. Future standards could add new
algorithms that use other ciphers to provide cryptographic agility in accordance
with {{?RFC7696}}. QUIC-LB implementations SHOULD be extensible to support new
algorithms.

### Special Case: Single Pass Encryption

When the nonce length and server ID length sum to exactly 16 octets, the server
MUST use a single-pass encryption algorithm. All connection ID octets except the
first form an AES-ECB block. This block is encrypted once, and the result forms
the second through seventeenth most significant bytes of the connection ID.

### General Case: Four-Pass Encryption

Any other field length requires four passes for encryption and at least three
for decryption. To understand this algorithm, it is useful to define four
functions that minimize the amount of bit-shifting necessary in the event that
there are an odd number of octets.

The expand_left() function outputs 16 octets, with its first argument in the
most significant bits, its second argument in the least significant byte, its
third argument in the second least significant byte, and zeros in all other
positions. Thus,

~~~pseudocode
expand_left(0xaaba3c, 0x0b, 0x02) =
                 0xaaba3c0000000000000000000000020b
~~~

expand_right() is similar, except that the second argument is in the most
significant byte, the third is in the second most significant byte, and the
first argument is in the least significant bits. Therefore,

~~~pseudocode
expand_right(0xaaba3c, 0x0b, 0x02) =
                  0x0b020000000000000000000000aaba3c
~~~

Similarly, truncate_left() and truncate_right() take the most significant and
least significant bits, respectively, from a ciphertext. For example, to take
28 bits of a ciphertext:

~~~pseudocode
truncate_left(0x2094842ca49256198c2deaa0ba53caa0, 28) = 0x2094842
truncate_right(0x2094842ca49256198c2deaa0ba53caa0, 28) = 0xa53caa0
~~~

The example at the end of this section helps to clarify the steps described
below.

1. The server concatenates the server ID and nonce to create plaintext_CID.

2. The server splits plaintext_CID into components left_0 and right_0 of equal
length, splitting an odd octet in half if necessary. For example,
0x7040b81b55ccf3 would split into a left_0 of 0x7040b81 and right_0 of
0xb55ccf3.

3. Encrypt the result of expand_left(left_0, index)) to obtain a ciphertext,
where 'index' is one octet: the two most significant bits of which are 0b00,
and the six least significant bits are the length of the resulting connection
ID in bytes, cid_len.

4. XOR the least significant bits of the ciphertext with right_0 to form
right_1.

    Thus steps 3 and 4 can be expressed as
    ```
    right_1 = right_0 ^ truncate_right(
                    AES_ECB(key, expand_left(left_0, cid_len, 1)),
                            len(right_0))
    ```

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4, but use them to compute left_1 by expanding and
encrypting right_1 with the most significant octet as the concatenation of
0b01 and cid_len, and XOR the results with left_0.

    ```
    left_1 = left_0 ^ truncate_left(
                   AES_ECB(key, expand_right(right_1, cid_len, 2)),
                           len(left_0))
    ```

6. Repeat steps 3 and 4, but use them to compute right_2 by expanding and
encrypting left_1 with the least significant octet as the concatenation of
0b10 and cid_len, and XOR the results with right_1.

    ```
    right_2 = right_1 ^ truncate_right(
                    AES_ECB(key, expand_left(left_1, cid_len, 3),
                            len(right_1))
    ```

7. Repeat steps 3 and 4, but use them to compute left_2 by expanding and
encrypting right_2 with the most significant octet as the concatenation of
0b11 ands cid_len, and XOR the results with left_1.

    ```
    left_2 = left_1 ^ truncate_left(
                  AES_ECB(key, expand_right(right_2, cid_len, 4),
                          len(left_1))
    ```

8. The server concatenates left_2 with right_2 to form the ciphertext CID,
which it appends to the first octet.

The following example executes the steps for the provided inputs. Note that the
plaintext is of odd octet length, so the middle octet will be split evenly
left_0 and right_0.

~~~pseudocode
server_id = 0x31441a
nonce = 0x9c69c275
key = 0xfdf726a9893ec05c0632d3956680baf0

// step 1
plaintext_CID = 0x31441a9c69c275

// step 2
left_0 = 0x31441a9
right_0 = 0xc69c275

// step 3
cid_len = 8
aes_input = 0x31441a90000000000000000000000108
ciphertext = 0xa60469a0a97d565da383af820e3b689a

// step 4
right_1 = 0xc69c275 ^ 0xe3b689a = 0x252aaef

// step 5
aes_input = 0x0802000000000000000000000252aaef
aes_output = 0xd7e5202ae06026c25d5f4d14d5ead17b
left_1 = 0x31441a9 ^ 0xd7e5202 = 0xe6a13ab

// step 6
aes_input = 0xe6a13ab0000000000000000000000308
aes_output = 0x9b6d9e6777cfc4bfb8bbdc63beb34a3d
right_2 = 0x252aaef ^ 0xeb34a3d = 0xce1e0d2

// step 7
aes_input = 0x0804000000000000000000000ce1e0d2
aes_output = 0xd462594b30327d88117ac542c8c33b52
left_2 = 0xe6a13ab ^ 0xd462594 = 0x32c363f

// step 8
cid = first_octet || left_2 || right_2 = 0x0732c363fce1e0d2
~~~

## Load Balancer Actions

On each incoming packet, the load balancer extracts consecutive octets,
beginning with the second octet. If there is no key, the first octets
correspond to the server ID.

If there is a key, the load balancer takes one of two actions:

### Special Case: Single Pass Encryption

If server ID length and nonce length sum to exactly 16 octets, they form a
ciphertext block. The load balancer decrypts the block using the AES-ECB key
and extracts the server ID from the most significant bytes of the resulting
plaintext.

### General Case: Four-Pass Encryption

First, split the ciphertext CID (excluding the first octet) into its equal-
length components left_2 and right_2. Then follow the process below:

~~~pseudocode
    left_1 = left_2 ^ truncate_left(
                  AES_ECB(key, expand_right(right_2, cid_len, 4),
                          len(left_1))
    right_1 = right_1 ^ truncate_right(
                  AES_ECB(key, expand_left(left_1, cid_len, 3),
                            len(right_1))
    left_0 = left_1 ^ truncate_left(
                  AES_ECB(key, expand_right(right_1, cid_len, 2),
                          len(left_1))
~~~

As the load balancer has no need for the nonce, it can conclude after 3 passes
as long as the server ID is entirely contained in left_0 (i.e., the nonce is at
least as large as the server ID). If the server ID is longer, a fourth pass
is necessary:

```
    right_0 = right_1 ^ truncate_right(
                   AES_ECB(key, expand_left(left_0, cid_len, 1),
                            len(right_1))
```

and the load balancer has to concatenate left_0 and right_0 to obtain the
complete server ID.

# Per-connection state

The CID allocation methods QUIC-LB defines require no per-connection state at
the load balancer. The load balancer can extract the server ID from the
connection ID of each incoming packet and route that packet accordingly.

However, once a routing decision has been made, the load balancer MAY
associate the 4-tuple or connection ID with the decision. This has two
advantages:

* The load balancer only extracts the server ID once until the 4-tuple or
connection ID changes. When the CID is encrypted, this might reduce
computational load.

* Incoming Stateless Reset packets and ICMP messages are easily routed to the
correct origin server.

In addition to the increased state requirements, however, load balancers cannot
detect the CONNECTION_CLOSE frame to indicate the end of the connection, so they
rely on a timeout to delete connection state. There are numerous considerations
around setting such a timeout.

In the event a connection ends, freeing an IP and port, and a different
connection migrates to that IP and port before the timeout, the load balancer
will misroute the different connection's packets to the original server. A short
timeout limits the likelihood of such a misrouting.

Furthermore, if a short timeout causes premature deletion of state, the routing
is easily recoverable by decoding an incoming Connection ID. However, a short
timeout also reduces the chance that an incoming Stateless Reset is correctly
routed.

Servers MAY implement the technique described in {{Section 14.4.1 of RFC9000}}
in case the load balancer is stateless, to increase the likelihood a Source
Connection ID is included in ICMP responses to Path Maximum Transmission Unit
(PMTU) probes.  Load balancers MAY parse the echoed packet to extract the Source
Connection ID, if it contains a QUIC long header, and extract the Server ID as
if it were in a Destination CID.

# Additional Use Cases

This section discusses considerations for some deployment scenarios not implied
by the specification above.

## Load balancer chains {#lb-chains}

Some network architectures may have multiple tiers of low-state load balancers,
where a first tier of devices makes a routing decision to the next tier, and so
on, until packets reach the server. Although QUIC-LB is not explicitly designed
for this use case, it is possible to support it.

If each load balancer is assigned a range of server IDs that is a subset of the
range of IDs assigned to devices that are closer to the client, then the first
devices to process an incoming packet can extract the server ID and then map it
to the correct forwarding address. Note that this solution is extensible to
arbitrarily large numbers of load-balancing tiers, as the maximum server ID
space is quite large.

If the number of necessary server IDs per next hop is uniform, a simple
implementation would use successively longer server IDs at each tier of load
balancing, and the server configuration would match the last tier. Load
balancers closer to the client can then treat any parts of the server ID they
did not use as part of the nonce.

## Server Process Demultiplexing

QUIC servers might have QUIC running on multiple processes listening on the same
address, and have a need to demultiplex between them. In principle, this
demultiplexer is a Layer 4 load balancer, and the guidance in {{lb-chains}}
applies. However, in many deployments the demultiplexer lacks the capability to
perform decryption operations. There are some other techniques that might work,
depending on the capabilities of the server architecture.

* Some bytes of the server ID are reserved to encode the process ID. The
demultiplexer might operate based on the 4-tuple or other legacy indicator, but
the receiving server process extracts the server ID, and if it does not match
the one for that process, the process could "toss" the packet to the correct
destination process.

* Each process could register the connection IDs it generates with the
demultiplexer, which routes those connection IDs accordingly.

* Some bytes of the server ID are reserved to encode the process ID. The load
balancer writes the decrypted connection ID into the packet. The demultiplexer
reads the process ID from the relevant bytes and routes it accordingly. The
receiving server process immediately re-encrypts the connection ID in deliver
the packet to the correct connection and successfully authenticate the packet.
While this requires coordination between load balancer and server, this document
does not standardize the technique because it is unsafe to use unless the path
between load balancer and server is fully secure. An observer at that point can
determine the server mapping via the IP address of the destination server, but
the process ID provides additional linkability information.

## Moving connections between servers

Some deployments may transparently move a connection from one server to another.
The means of transferring connection state between servers is out of scope of
this document.

To support a handover, a server involved in the transition could issue CIDs that
map to the new server via a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame, and retire CIDs associated
with the new server using the "Retire Prior To" field in that frame.

Alternately, if the old server is going offline, the load balancer could simply
map its server ID to the new server's address.

# Version Invariance of QUIC-LB {#version-invariance}

The server ID encodings, and requirements for their handling, are designed to be
QUIC version independent (see {{RFC8999}}). A QUIC-LB load balancer will
generally not require changes as servers deploy new versions of QUIC. However,
there are several unlikely future design decisions that could impact the
operation of QUIC-LB.

A QUIC version might define limits on connection ID length that make some or all
of the mechanisms in this document unusable.  For example, a maximum connection
ID length could be below the minimum necessary to use all or part of this
specification; or, the minimum connection ID length could be larger than the
largest value in this specification.

{{unroutable}} provides guidance about how load balancers should handle
unroutable DCIDs. This guidance, and the implementation of an algorithm to
handle these DCIDs, rests on some assumptions:

* Incoming short headers do not contain DCIDs that are client-generated.
* The use of client-generated incoming DCIDs does not persist beyond a few round
trips in the connection.
* While the client is using DCIDs it generated, some exposed fields (IP address,
UDP port, client-generated destination Connection ID) remain constant for all
packets sent on the same connection.

While this document does not update the commitments in {{RFC8999}}, the
additional assumptions are minimal and narrowly scoped, and provide a likely
set of constants that load balancers can use with minimal risk of version-
dependence.

If these assumptions are not valid, this specification is likely to lead to loss
of packets that contain unroutable DCIDs, and in extreme cases connection
failure.  A QUIC version that violates the assumptions in this section therefore
cannot be safely deployed with a load balancer that follows this specification.
An updated or alternative version of this specification might address these
shortcomings for such a QUIC version.

Some load balancers might inspect version-specific elements of packets to make a
routing decision.  This might include the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension
in the TLS Client Hello.  The format and cryptographic protection of this
information may change in future versions or extensions of TLS or QUIC, and
therefore this functionality is inherently not version-invariant. Such a load
balancer, when it receives packets from an unknown QUIC version, might misdirect
initial packets to the wrong tenant.  While this can be inefficient, the design
in this document preserves the ability for tenants to deploy new versions
provided they have an out-of-band means of providing a connection ID for the
client to use.

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

QUIC-LB is intended to prevent linkability.  Attacks would therefore attempt to
subvert this purpose.

Note that without a key for the encoding, QUIC-LB makes no attempt to obscure
the server mapping, and therefore does not address these concerns. Without a
key, QUIC-LB merely allows consistent CID encoding for compatibility across a
network infrastructure, which makes QUIC robust to NAT rebinding. Servers that
are encoding their server ID without a key algorithm SHOULD only use it to
generate new CIDs for the Server Initial Packet and SHOULD NOT send CIDs in QUIC
NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames, except that it sends one new Connection ID in the
event of config rotation {{config-rotation}}. Doing so might falsely suggest to
the client that said CIDs were generated in a secure fashion.

A linkability attack would find some means of determining that two connection
IDs route to the same server. As described above, there is no scheme that
strictly prevents linkability for all traffic patterns, and therefore efforts to
frustrate any analysis of server ID encoding have diminishing returns.

## Attackers not between the load balancer and server

Any attacker might open a connection to the server infrastructure and
aggressively simulate migration to obtain a large sample of IDs that map to the
same server. It could then apply analytical techniques to try to obtain the
server encoding.

An encrypted encoding provides robust protection against this. An unencrypted
one provides none.

Were this analysis to obtain the server encoding, then on-path observers might
apply this analysis to correlating different client IP addresses.

## Attackers between the load balancer and server

Attackers in this privileged position are intrinsically able to map two
connection IDs to the same server.  The QUIC-LB algorithms do prevent the
linkage of two connection IDs to the same individual connection if servers make
reasonable selections when generating new IDs for that connection.

## Multiple Configuration IDs {#multiple-configs}

During the period in which there are multiple deployed configuration IDs (see
{{config-rotation}}), there is a slight increase in linkability. The server
space is effectively divided into segments with CIDs that have different config
rotation bits. Entities that manage servers SHOULD strive to minimize these
periods by quickly deploying new configurations across the server pool.

## Limited configuration scope

A simple deployment of QUIC-LB in a cloud provider might use the same global
QUIC-LB configuration across all its load balancers that route to customer
servers. An attacker could then simply become a customer, obtain the
configuration, and then extract server IDs of other customers' connections at
will.

To avoid this, the configuration agent SHOULD issue QUIC-LB configurations to
mutually distrustful servers that have different keys for encryption
algorithms. In many cases, the load balancers can distinguish these
configurations by external IP address.

However, assigning multiple entities to an IP address is complimentary with
concealing DNS requests (e.g., DoH {{?RFC8484}}) and the TLS Server Name
Indicator (SNI) ({{?I-D.ietf-tls-esni}}) to obscure the ultimate destination
of traffic. While the load balancer's fallback algorithm
({{fallback-algorithm}}) can use the SNI to make a routing decision on the
first packet, there are three ways to route subsequent packets:

* all co-tenants can use the same QUIC-LB configuration, leaking the server
mapping to each other as described above;

* co-tenants can be issued one of up to three configurations distinguished by
the config rotation bits ({{config-rotation}}), exposing information about the
target domain to the entire network; or

* tenants can use the 0b11 codepoint in their CIDs (in which case they SHOULD
disable migration in their connections), which neutralizes the value of
QUIC-LB but preserves privacy.

When configuring QUIC-LB, administrators must evaluate the privacy tradeoff
considering the relative value of each of these properties, given the trust
model between tenants, the presence of methods to obscure the domain name, and
value of address migration in the tenant use cases.

As the plaintext algorithm makes no attempt to conceal the server mapping,
these deployments SHOULD simply use a common configuration.

## Stateless Reset Oracle

Section 21.9 of {{RFC9000}} discusses the Stateless Reset Oracle attack.  For a
server deployment to be vulnerable, an attacking client must be able to cause
two packets with the same Destination CID to arrive at two different servers
that share the same cryptographic context for Stateless Reset tokens. As QUIC-LB
requires deterministic routing of DCIDs over the life of a connection, it is a
sufficient means of avoiding an Oracle without additional measures.

Note also that when a server starts using a new QUIC-LB config rotation
codepoint, new CIDs might not be unique with respect to previous configurations
that occupied that codepoint, and therefore different clients may have observed
the same CID and stateless reset token. A straightforward method of managing
stateless reset keys is to maintain a separate key for each config rotation
codepoint, and replace each key when the configuration for that codepoint
changes. Thus, a server transitions from one config to another, it will be able
to generate correct tokens for connections using either type of CID.

## Connection ID Entropy {#cid-entropy}

If a server ever reuses a nonce in generating a CID for a given configuration,
it risks exposing sensitive information. Given the same server ID, the CID will
be identical (aside from a possible difference in the first octet).  This can
risk exposure of the QUIC-LB key. If two clients receive the same connection ID,
they also have each other's stateless reset token unless that key has changed in
the interim.

The encrypted mode needs to generate different cipher text for each generated
Connection ID instance to protect the Server ID. To do so, at least four octets
of the CID are reserved for a nonce that, if used only once, will result in
unique cipher text for each Connection ID.

If servers simply increment the nonce by one with each generated connection ID,
then it is safe to use the existing keys until any server's nonce counter
exhausts the allocated space and rolls over. To maximize entropy, servers SHOULD
start with a random nonce value, in which case the configuration is usable until
the nonce value wraps around to zero and then reaches the initial value again.

Whether or not it implements the counter method, the server MUST NOT reuse a
nonce until it switches to a configuration with new keys.

If the nonce is sent in plaintext, servers MUST generate nonces so that they
appear to be random. Observable correlations between plaintext nonces would
provide trivial linkability between individual connections, rather than just to
a common server.

For any algorithm, configuration agents SHOULD implement an out-of-band method
to discover when servers are in danger of exhausting their nonce space, and
SHOULD respond by issuing a new configuration. A server that has exhausted its
nonces MUST either switch to a different configuration, or if none exists, use
the 4-tuple routing config rotation codepoint.

When sizing a nonce that is to be randomly generated, the configuration agent
SHOULD consider that a server generating a N-bit nonce will create a duplicate
about every 2^(N/2) attempts, and therefore compare the expected rate at which
servers will generate CIDs with the lifetime of a configuration.

## Distinguishing Attacks

The Four Pass Encryption algorithm is structured as a 4-round Feistel network
with non-bijective round function. As such, it does not offer a very high
security level against distinguishing attacks, as explained in [Patarin2008].
Attackers can mount these attacks if they are in possession of O(SQRT(len/2))
pairs of ciphertext and known corresponding plain text, where "len" is the
sum of the lengths of the Server ID and the Nonce.

The authors considered increasing the number of passes from 4 to 12,
which would definitely block these attacks. However, this would require
12 round of AES decryption by load balancers accessing the CID, a cost deemed
prohibitive in the planned deployments.

The attacks described in [Patarin2008] rely on known plain text. In a normal
deployment, the plain text is only known by the server that generates the ID
and by the load balancer that decrypts the content of the CID. Attackers
would have to compensate by guesses about the allocation of server identifiers
or the generation of nonces. The these attacks are thus mitigated by making
nonces hard to guess, as specified in {{cid-entropy}}, and by rules related
to mixed deployments that use both clear text CID and encrypted CID, for
example when transitioning from clear text to encryption. Such deployments
MUST use different server ID allocations for the clear text and the
encrypted versions.

These attacks cannot be mounted against the Single Pass Encryption algorithm.

# Interoperability with DTLS over UDP

Some environments may contain DTLS traffic as well as QUIC operating over UDP,
which may be hard to distinguish.

In most cases, the packet parsing rules above will cause a QUIC-LB load
balancer to route DTLS traffic in an appropriate way. DTLS 1.3 implementations
that use the connection_id extension {{?I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} might
use the techniques in this document to generate connection IDs and achieve
robust routability for DTLS associations if they meet a few additional
requirements. This non-normative appendix describes this interaction.

## DTLS 1.0 and 1.2

DTLS 1.0 {{?RFC4347}} and 1.2 {{?RFC6347}} use packet formats that a QUIC-LB
router will interpret as short header packets with CIDs that request 4-tuple
routing.  As such, they will route such packets consistently as long as the
4-tuple does not change. Note that DTLS 1.0 has been deprecated by the IETF.

The first octet of every DTLS 1.0 or 1.2 datagram contains the content type.
A QUIC-LB load balancer will interpret any content type less than 128 as a short
header packet, meaning that the subsequent octets should contain a connection
ID.

Existing TLS content types comfortably fit in the range below 128. Assignment of
codepoints greater than 64 would require coordination in accordance with
{{?RFC7983}}, and anyway would likely create problems demultiplexing DTLS and
version 1 of QUIC. Therefore, this document believes it is extremely unlikely
that TLS content types of 128 or greater will be assigned. Nevertheless, such
an assignment would cause a QUIC-LB load balancer to interpret the packet as a
QUIC long header with an essentially random connection ID, which is likely to be
routed irregularly.

The second octet of every DTLS 1.0 or 1.2 datagram is the bitwise complement
of the DTLS Major version (i.e. version 1.x = 0xfe). A QUIC-LB load balancer
will interpret this as a connection ID that requires 4-tuple based load
balancing, meaning that the routing will be consistent as long as the 4-tuple
remains the same.

{{?I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} defines an extension to add connection IDs
to DTLS 1.2. Unfortunately, a QUIC-LB load balancer will not correctly parse
the connection ID and will continue 4-tuple routing. An modified QUIC-LB load
balancer that correctly identifies DTLS and parses a DTLS 1.2 datagram for
the connection ID is outside the scope of this document.

## DTLS 1.3

DTLS 1.3 {{?I-D.draft-ietf-tls-dtls13}} changes the structure of datagram
headers in relevant ways.

Handshake packets continue to have a TLS content type in the first octet and
0xfe in the second octet, so they will be 4-tuple routed, which should not
present problems for likely NAT rebinding or address change events.

Non-handshake packets always have zero in their most significant bit and will
therefore always be treated as QUIC short headers. If the connection ID is
present, it follows in the succeeding octets. Therefore, a DTLS 1.3 association
where the server utilizes Connection IDs and the encodings in this document
will be routed correctly in the presence of client address and port changes.

However, if the client does not include the connection_id extension in its
ClientHello, the server is unable to use connection IDs. In this case, non-
handshake packets will appear to contain random connection IDs and be routed
randomly. Thus, unmodified QUIC-LB load balancers will not work with DTLS 1.3
if the client does not advertise support for connection IDs, or the server does
not request the use of a compliant connection ID.

A QUIC-LB load balancer might be modified to identify DTLS 1.3 packets and
correctly parse the fields to identify when there is no connection ID and
revert to 4-tuple routing, removing the server requirement above. However, such
a modification is outside the scope of this document, and classifying some
packets as DTLS might be incompatible with future versions of QUIC.

## Future Versions of DTLS

As DTLS does not have an IETF consensus document that defines what parts of
DTLS will be invariant in future versions, it is difficult to speculate about
the applicability of this section to future versions of DTLS.
